Notes:
• See also the Solidity Style Guide: http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style-guide.html
• This is subject to change!
• I am not suggesting this for anybody else.
• It is just for me and my pedantic coding style.

Variable Naming Convention
==========================
Visibility          Name Starts with:
----------
private             p plus s, m, r from the "Where/How" list below
public              u "
constant            c plus name in all caps
local (stack)       k
Passed by Value     v

Where/How           Second letter for p and u visibility variables
---------
storage             s
memory              m
Passed by Reference r

Type      Name ends with capital letter
----
uint      U or nothing as the default
address   A
bool      B Also sometimes used for functions returning a bool
string    S Also used for functions returning a string
struct    R plus struct declaration names start with R_ Capital letter
enum      N plus enum   declaration names start with N_ Capital letter

Second Last Letter or last if default type uint with no "U"
Y  array    (not A to be unique, leaving A for address)
M  mapping

Other conventions
A variable name ending in 'X' is a uint array index.

Visibility
----------
Explicitly mark visibility in functions and state variables
from https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices#explicitly-mark-visibility-in-functions-and-state-variables

Explicitly label the visibility of functions and state variables.
Labeling the visibility explicitly will make it easier to catch incorrect assumptions about who can call the function or access the variable.

Functions can be specified as being external, public, internal or private.

For state variables, external is not possible.
